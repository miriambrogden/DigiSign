DigiSign was an end-of-term team project designed to help users manage a digital signage display showcasing advertisements. The main purpose of this project was to build a content management system where administrators and advertisers can log in to manage the advertisements being displayed. Advertisers can upload photos/videos and request that these advertisements are displayed on the signage system at a specific time. Administrators can approve requests, manage advertiser accounts, and change widget options for the Preview Screen.
